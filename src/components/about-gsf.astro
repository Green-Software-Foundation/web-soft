          About the Green Software Foundation
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-primary-darkest">
          WDPC is being developed by the Green Software Foundation (GSF), a nonprofit consortium
          under the Linux Foundation dedicated to building a future where software has zero harmful
          environmental impact. With steering members including Accenture, Avanade, BCG X, Cisco,
          Google, Microsoft, NTT Data, Siemens, and UBS, GSF brings together industry leaders to
          create open standards that make sustainable computing achievable at scale.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-primary-darkest">
          Beyond WDPC, the foundation maintains the ISO-certified Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)
          specification, develops open-source tools like the Impact Framework and Carbon Aware SDK,
          and has trained over 130,000 practitioners in green software principles worldwide. GSF's
          standards and tools are already in production at organizations globally, proving that
          performance and sustainability can work together.
