          About the Green Software Foundation
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-primary-darkest">
          The SOFT framework is developed and maintained by the Green Software Foundation (GSF), a
          nonprofit consortium under the Linux Foundation dedicated to building a future where
          software has zero harmful environmental impact. With steering members including Accenture,
          Avanade, BCG X, Cisco, Google, Microsoft, NTT Data, Siemens, and UBS, GSF unites industry
          leaders to create practical standards and frameworks that make sustainable software
          achievable for organizations of all sizes.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-primary-darkest">
          GSF's proven track record includes the ISO-certified Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)
          specification already in use globally, open-source tools like the Impact Framework and
          Carbon Aware SDK, and training programs that have reached over 130,000 practitioners
          worldwide. SOFT builds on this foundation, providing the organizational transformation
          framework that turns individual green software practices into systematic, measurable
          change.
